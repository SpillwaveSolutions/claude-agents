# CLAUDE.md - Agents Directory

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with agent configurations in this directory.

## Directory Purpose

This directory is dedicated to developing and managing custom Claude Code agents. Agents are specialized assistants that handle specific types of tasks autonomously.

## Working with Agents

When developing or modifying agents in this directory:

1. **Agent Structure**: Each agent should have clear, well-defined capabilities and use cases
2. **Documentation**: Document the agent's purpose, tools available, and when it should be invoked
3. **Testing**: Test agents thoroughly before deployment
4. **Version Control**: Track agent configurations in git to maintain history and enable rollback

## File Organization

- Keep agent-related files organized and clearly named
- Use descriptive names that indicate the agent's purpose
- Document any dependencies or requirements

## Quality Standards

- Ensure agent prompts are clear and unambiguous
- Define specific trigger conditions for when agents should be used
- Document expected inputs and outputs
- Include examples of proper agent usage

## Notes

This is a working directory for agent development. Experimental or work-in-progress agents should be clearly marked as such.
